# CINEMAS
**Author: Cezary Petryka**

It is an application that enables cinemas management. Requirements:
- Data for the database is taken from JSON files.
- CRUD operations are provided for all database tables.
- The application allows the management of films and showings.
- The application allows user account management (password change etc.)
- The application allows tickets to be bought and booked. The user enters a certain query (e.g. ACTION,WARSAW,2020-11-10,14), matching showings are displayed and the user can then select the desired showing. The user then selects seats. After seats selection, user decides whether he/she wants only to reserve the ticket or buy it.
- Periodically, unpaid tickets are automatically cancelled.
